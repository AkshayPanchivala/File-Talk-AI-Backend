**Acids and Bases: Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis Theories**
=================================================================

### 3.3.1 Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases

According to Arrhenius, acids and bases are defined as follows:

* Acid: A substance that contains hydrogen and gives rise to H+ ions in aqueous solution.
* Base: A substance that contains OH group and produces hydroxide ions (OH-) in aqueous solution.

Examples of Arrhenius acids and bases include:

* HCl (aq) → H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)
* NaOH (aq) → Na+ (aq) + OH- (aq)

However, Arrhenius theory has limitations, such as not accounting for the basicity of NH3 and Na2CO3, which do not have OH groups.

### 3.3.2 Bronsted-Lowry Theory

The Bronsted-Lowry theory defines acids and bases as follows:

* Acid: A substance that donates a proton (H+).
* Base: A substance that accepts a proton (H+).

Examples of Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases include:

* HCl + NH3 → NH4+ + Cl-
* HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-

All Bronsted bases are also Lewis bases, but not all Lewis acids are Bronsted acids.

### 3.3.3 Lewis Theory

The Lewis theory defines acids and bases as follows:

* Acid: Any species that accepts a share in an electron pair.
* Base: Any species that donates a share in an electron pair.

Examples of Lewis acids and bases include:

* BF3 + NH3 → F3B-NH3 (acid-base complex)
* AlCl3 + Cl- → AlCl4- (acid-base complex)

### 3.4 Ionization of Acids and Bases

Acids and bases can be classified as strong or weak based on their extent of dissociation in water.

**Strong Acids and Bases**

* Strong acids, such as HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4, are almost completely dissociated in water.
* Strong bases, such as NaOH and KOH, are also almost completely dissociated in water.

**Weak Acids and Bases**

* Weak acids, such as CH3COOH and HF, are partially dissociated in water.
* Weak bases, such as NH4OH and Fe(OH)3, are also partially dissociated in water.

### 3.4.1 Dissociation Constant of Weak Acids and Weak Bases

The dissociation constant (Ka or Kb) of a weak acid or weak base is a measure of its ability to dissociate in water.

* Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA] (for weak acids)
* Kb = [B+][OH-] / [BOH] (for weak bases)

### 3.4.2 Ostwald's Dilution Law

Ostwald's dilution law relates the degree of dissociation of a weak acid or weak base to its concentration.

* For weak acids: Ka = ∝2c / (1 - ∝) (where ∝ is the degree of dissociation)
* For weak bases: Kb = ∝2c / (1 - ∝)

### 3.5 Autoionization of Water

Water can ionize to a small extent, resulting in the formation of hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions.

* H2O (l) + H2O (l) → H3O+ (aq) + OH- (aq)
* Kw = [H3O+][OH-] = 1.0 × 10-14 (at 298 K)

### 3.6 pH Scale

The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to express the concentration of H3O+ ions in a solution.

* pH = -log10[H3O+]
* pOH = -log10[OH-]

The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with pH 7 being neutral (neither acidic nor basic).

### 3.6.1 Relationship Between pH and pOH

The ionic product of water (Kw) is related to pH and pOH as follows:

* pH + pOH = 14

### 3.6.2 Acidity, Basicity, and Neutrality of Aqueous Solutions

* Neutral solution: [H3O+] = [OH-] = 1.0 × 10-7 M (pH = 7)
* Acidic solution: [H3O+] > [OH-] (pH < 7)
* Basic solution: [H3O+] < [OH-] (pH > 7)

Examples of acidity, basicity, and neutrality of aqueous solutions include:

* 0.01 M HCl solution: [H3O+] = 1.0 × 10-2 M (pH = 2)
* pH of a solution with [H3O+] = 7.586 × 10-4 M: pH = 3.12
